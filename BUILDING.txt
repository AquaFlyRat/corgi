Requirements:
	- Conan
	- CMake

Build Process:

These instructions assume that conan and cmake are installed, in the PATH and working.

First of all add add the bincrafters package to conan.
 $ conan remote add bincrafters "https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan"

Then clone the git repository (Skip if already done, obviously)
 $ git clone https://github.com/AquaFlyRat/corgi.git

From a terminal navigate into the root directory of the project.
 $ cd corgi

Create a "build" directory.
 $ mkdir build

Navigate into that build directory
 $ cd build

Then use Conan to install the nessersary packages.
 $ conan install ..

Now generate the build files themselves with CMake
 $ cmake -H../ -B.

Now build & run the project, using whatever system CMake has generated.
CMake can run the build for you by running
 $ cmake --build .
from the "build" directory.

Otherwise you can just run 
 $ make
if using the Makefile generator, or Ninja or whatever.

The binary will be in "build/bin"
