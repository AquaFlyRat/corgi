Requirements:
	- Conan
	- CMake

Build Process:

These instructions assume that conan and cmake are installed, in the PATH and working.

First of all add add the bincrafters package to conan.
 $ conan remote add bincrafters "https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan"

Then clone the git repository (Skip if already done, obviously)
 $ git clone https://github.com/AquaFlyRat/corgi.git

From a terminal navigate into the root directory of the project.
 $ cd corgi

Generate the project files by invoking CMake, at the bear minimum by running
 $ cmake -H. -Bbuild

Now build & run the project, using whatever system CMake has generated.
CMake can run the build for you by running
 $ cmake --build build

Otherwise you can just run 
 $ make
from the build directory if using the Makefile generator, or follow
the build system specific process.

The binary will be (somewhere, depending on build system) in the "build/"
folder.
For Makefile like generators probably in "build/" and for VS probably in 
"build/Debug" or "build/Release"
